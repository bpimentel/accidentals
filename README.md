#jQuery Accidentals

This [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) plugin converts musical ["accidental"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_(music\)) symbols typed in plain text into actual symbols:

`A-flat` → `A♭`

It is strongly suggested that this plugin be used in conjunction with a web font that includes glyphs for musical accidental symbols (flat, sharp, and natural, plus preferably double-flat and double-sharp), or that testing be done to determine if the device is capable of displaying these symbols correctly.
